This Python script is designed to take a series of simple arithmetic problemsâ€”addition and subtractionâ€”and arrange them neatly in a vertical format, similar to how you would solve problems on paper. I created this project to solidify my understanding of string manipulation, loops, and basic Python syntax. It was a fun and rewarding challenge, and completing it helped me gain confidence in solving real-world problems programmatically.
