Using Godot or another language like javascript would have been an easier language. Python is not a language of games or UI nevertheless and Tetris game! I used coloured emojis like {ðŸŸ¥ ðŸŸ¦ ðŸŸ¨} to make a decent enough appeal. It took me weeks to make this...So far this is my hardest and most complex project! \nHave a look at the code at the github page below!", "Tetris-Game-Coding.png", "https://github.com/horseywin/Tetris-Game", "tetris-popup");
//Arithmetic Arranger
addPopUp("Arithmetic Arranger", "The Arithmetic Arranger is one of my early coding projects, developed as part of an assessment in FreeCodeCamps Scientific Computing with Python course. This Python script is designed to take a series of simple arithmetic problemsâ€”addition and subtractionâ€”and arrange them neatly in a vertical format, similar to how you would solve problems on paper. I created this project to solidify my understanding of string manipulation, loops, and basic Python syntax. It was a fun and rewarding challenge, and completing it helped me gain confidence in solving real-world problems programmatically.
